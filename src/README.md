nothing smart nor sophisticated, you wont find any A.I.,bots,nor sophisticated algorithms here.(who do you think we are, some city slicker with a fancy german built car and gucci loafers?)

- run main.lua with these three arguments:  
    - input file
      - the file containing the input text. should be a simple text file.
    - length
      - how many words to generate based on input. should be a positive integer value.
    - output file
      - the file to write text to. if none is included then default to using stdout.
